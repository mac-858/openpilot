"""BluePilot: connect backend selection (comma / Konik / offline).

BPConnectBackend (int) selects where the device sends routes and telemetry:

  0 = Comma Connect  — stock openpilot defaults (API_HOST / ATHENA_HOST unset)
  1 = Konik Stable   — api.konik.ai / athena.konik.ai (stable.konik.ai pairing)
  2 = Offline Mode   — bogus hosts so uploads and athena can never succeed

launch_env.sh exports API_HOST / ATHENA_HOST from this param. openpilot already
reads those env vars everywhere it talks to the backend (common/api/comma_connect.py,
system/athena/athenad.py, registration, uploader), so no other host wiring is needed.

Dongle ID handling (register() calls reconcile_backend on every manager start):

- comma connect: factory dongle ID, recoverable from /persist/comma/dongle_id (devices
  built since 2/28/24) or by re-registering (comma's backend recognizes the persistent
  RSA keypair).
- Konik (connect-killer): deterministic dongle ID, sha256(imei+imei2+serial+public_key)[:16],
  assigned by its /v2/pilotauth on first registration. Registration is idempotent, so the
  same device always maps to the same Konik ID.
- Offline: keep the current DongleId (or UnregisteredDevice); never hit the network.

Each real backend's ID is cached the first time it is seen, so after one registration
per backend, switching comma <-> Konik is a pure param swap on reboot.

First-run migration (devices upgrading from a build that predates BPActiveBackend):
there's no way to tell which backend an inherited DongleId belongs to just from its
format (Konik IDs are the same 16-char hex shape as comma's). We disambiguate using
/persist/comma/dongle_id, which only ever holds comma's own factory-assigned ID: if the
current DongleId matches it, the inherited ID really is comma's and today's normal
switch-and-cache behavior applies. If it doesn't match (or the persist file doesn't
exist), the ID's origin is unknown -- e.g. a device registered against Konik entirely
outside this code (older flash.konik.ai builds, before BPConnectBackend/backend_switch.py
existed). In that case we do NOT run the destructive stash-then-clear branch: we assume
the existing ID already belongs to the currently selected target and cache it there
untouched. Getting this wrong by guessing "comma" is what silently destroyed a working,
already-registered Konik DongleId on a device that predates this file (see bp_dongle
field report, 2026-07).
